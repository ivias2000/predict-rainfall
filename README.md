# predict-rainfall
The code provided is a Python script for building a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network model to predict whether the annual rainfall in a given year will be higher or lower than the next year. The dataset used is from the "rainfall.csv" file.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:

The code imports the necessary libraries, including Pandas, NumPy, Math, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Keras, and others.

The rainfall data is read from the "rainfall.csv" file and stored in the Pandas DataFrame called data.

Data preprocessing is performed by filling any missing values in the DataFrame with the mean of the respective columns.

The code then displays various exploratory data analysis (EDA) visualizations, including scatter plots, box plots, histograms, and violin plots, to explore the data distribution and relationships between different attributes.

The data is split into input features (X) and target labels (Y), and then it's further divided into training and testing sets using the train_test_split() method.

The LSTM model is defined using the Keras Sequential API. The model architecture consists of LSTM layers followed by Dense (fully connected) layers.

The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss for binary classification. The accuracy metric is also specified.

The training process begins using the fit() method, and the model is trained on the training data with the specified number of epochs.

The training history is then plotted using Matplotlib to visualize the loss and accuracy during the training process.

Overall, the code aims to predict whether the next year's annual rainfall will be higher or lower based on historical data. LSTM is chosen for this task as it can effectively handle sequence data and capture temporal patterns, making it suitable for time series prediction tasks like this one. The model's performance can be evaluated based on the training and validation loss and accuracy plots, which can help determine if the model is overfitting or generalizing well to new data.
